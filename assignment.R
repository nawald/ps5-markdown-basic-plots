##*pm2.5_35**: PM2.5 pollution, population exposed to levels exceeding WHO Interim Target-1 value
  ##36ug/m3 (
##*battleDeaths**: Battle-related deaths (number of people)


##1 Load and check data (5pt)
##You first task is to do a very simple data check:
##1. (1pt) For solving the problems, and answering the questions, create a new rmarkdown docu-
  ##ment with an appropriate title. See https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/
  ##r-markdown.html#r-markdown-rstudio-creating.
##2. (2pt) Load data. How many rows/columns do we have?
##3. (2pt) Print a small sample of data. Does it look OK?


##2 Descriptive statistics (15pt)
##1. (3pt) How many countries are there in the dataset? Analyze all three: iso3, iso2 and name.
##2. If you did this correctly, you saw that there are more names than iso-2 codes, and there are
  ##even more iso3 -codes. What is going on? Can you find it out?
##(a) (5pt) Find how many names are there for each iso-2 code. Are there any iso-2 codes that
    ##correspond to more than one name? What are these countries?
##(b) (5pt) Now repeat the same for name and iso3-code. Are there country names that have
  ##more than one iso3-code? What are these countries?
  ##Hint: two of these entitites are CHANISL and NLD CURACAO.
##3. (2pt) What is the minimum and maximum year in these data?



##3 CO2 emissions (30pt)
##Next, let’s analyze CO2 emissions.
##1. (2pt) How many missing co2 emissions are there for each year? Analyze both missing CO2
  ##and co2_PC. Which years have most missing data?
##2. (5pt) Make a plot of total CO2 emissions over time for the U.S, China, and India. Add a few
  ##more countries of your choice. Explain what do you see.
##3. (5pt) Now let’s analyze the CO2 emissions per capita (co2_PC ). Make a similar plot of the
  ##same countries. What does this figure suggest?
##4. (6pt) Compute average CO2 emissions per capita across the continents (assume region is the
  ##same as continent). Comment what do you see.
##Note: just compute averages over countries and ignore the fact that countries are of different
  ##size.
##Hint: Americas 2016 should be 4.80.
##5. (7pt) Make a barplot where you show the previous results–average CO2 emissions per capita
  ##across continents in 1960 and 2016.
##6. Which countries are the three largest, and three smallest CO2 emitters (in terms of CO2 per
  ##capita) in 2019 for each continent? (Assume region is continent).
##4 GDP per capita (50pt)

##Let’s look at GDP per capita (GDP_PC ).
##1. (8pt) Make a scatterplot of GDP per capita versus life expectancy by country, using data for
  ##1960. Make the point size dependent on the country size, and color those according to the
  ##continent. Feel free to adjust the plot in other ways to make it better.
  ##Comment what do you see there.
##2. (4pt) Make a similar plot, but this time use 2019 data only.

##3. (6pt) Compare these two plots and comment what do you see. How has world developed
  ##through the last 60 years?
##4. (6pt) Compute the average life expectancy for each continent in 1960 and 2019. Do the results
  ##fit with what do you see on the figures?
  ##Note: here as average I mean just average over countries, ignore the fact that countries are of
  ##different size.
##5. (8pt) Compute the average LE growth from 1960-2019 across the continents. Show the results
  ##in the order of growth. Explain what do you see.
  ##Hint: these data (data in long form) is not the simplest to compute growth. But you may
  ##want to check out the lag() function. And do not forget to group data by continent when
  ##using lag(), otherwise your results will be messed up! See https://faculty.washington.
  ##edu/otoomet/info201-book/dplyr.html#dplyr-helpers-compute.
##6. (6pt) Show the histogram of GDP per capita for years of 1960 and 2019. Try to put both
##histograms on the same graph, see how well you can do it!
##7. (6pt) What was the ranking of US in terms of life expectancy in 1960 and in 2019? (When
##counting from top.)
  ##Hint: check out the function rank()!
  ##Hint2: 17 for 1960.
##8. (6pt) If you did this correctly, then you noticed that US ranking has been falling quite a
  ##bit. But we also have more countries in 2019–what about the relative rank divided by the
  ##corresponding number of countries that have LE data in the corresponding year?
  ##Hint: 0.0904 for 1960.

##Finally tell us how many hours did you spend on this PS.
